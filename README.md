# 2-in-n
Given N bottles of samples, up to 2 of them are poisoned.  You can use some mice to exam any subsets of samples and for each exam it will show whether the subset contains a poisoned sample.  Design a strategy that minimize the number of exams in the worst case.  Also design strategies that only need minimal number of rounds (less interactive).
